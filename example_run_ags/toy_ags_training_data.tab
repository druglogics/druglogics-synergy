# AGS training data
#
# An unperturbed steady state is signified by a '-'
#
# Observations can be stated as floating point absolutes [0..1]
# or as floating point relatives [0..1], prepended by a + or - sign to 
# signify an observation relative to the unperturbed condition. 
# +0 and -0 means no change.
#
# (Currently two or more specified conditions not supported, only relative
# to unperturbed system, this could be implemented by e.g. +/- prepending of 
# also input conditions)
#
# In this example steady state data and perturbation data is taken from 
# Flobak et al. 2015, PLoS comput biol, see sup tables S3/S4 (steady state) and 
# S6 (perturbation)
